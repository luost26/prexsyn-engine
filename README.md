PrexSyn Engine is the C++ backend library for PrexSyn. It provides a high-throughput data pipeline that generates synthetic pathways annotated with molecular properties to train PrexSyn models. It also includes a fast detokenizer for reconstructing synthetic pathways and product molecules from model outputs.
